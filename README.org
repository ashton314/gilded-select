#+TITLE: Gilded Select

Minor enhancements to the excellent [[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum][Selectrum]] package

* Description

The one thing that I miss from the [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Counsel]] package is how keybindings are displayed next to the functions when you run ~M-x~. Another thing that I want is for every active or inactive minor mode to be colored red or green.

If you're anything like me, you'll like this package.

*NOTE*: Emacs 28 should include most (if not all) of these annotations by default, so this package will most likely no longer be relevant. As of writing, I'm running Emacs 27.1, so I needed to write a package to add these annotations for me.

* Installation

Until I get this package up on Melpa, you'll have to install from source.

If you're using [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]], this incantation should work:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package '(gilded-select :type git :host github :repo "ashton314/gilded-select"))
(gilded-select-mode +1)
#+end_src

Otherwise, follow the installation instructions for [[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum][Selectrum]], clone this repository, put gilded-select.el into your load path, and then add

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'gilded-select)
(gilded-select-mode +1)
#+end_src

into your =.emacs= file.

* Usage

Turning on ~gilded-select-mode~ will automatically turn on ~selectrum-mode~ as well.

Run =M-x gilded-rehash-keybindings= when switching to a new major mode to index the keybindings for that mode.a

I'm still figuring out the best way to gather up all the keybindings. Right now, Gilded-Select rather stupidly maps over the ~obarray~ [fn:1] and builds up a hash table so running =M-x= is fast. If you have any suggestions on how this can be improved, please drop me a line or submit a pull request.

* Contributing

This is my very first published package; I'm struggling to find a good set of best-practices for creating and distributing packages, so any pull requests or suggestions are welcome.

[fn:1] ~obarray~ variable documentation: (run =C-h v obarray RET=)
#+begin_quote
Symbol table for use by ‘intern’ and ‘read’.
It is a vector whose length ought to be prime for best results.
The vector’s contents don’t make sense if examined from Lisp programs;
to find all the symbols in an obarray, use ‘mapatoms’.
#+end_quote
